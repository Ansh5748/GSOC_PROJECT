Project Name:
College Management System for Attendance and Form Handling

Objective:
A streamlined, secure, and user-friendly College Management System to prevent attendance proxy, ensure efficient form distribution, and provide a robust problem-reporting system.

Key Features:
1. Attendance Management System
QR Code-Based Attendance:
A unique QR code is generated at the start of each class.
Students must scan the QR code to mark their attendance.
Attendance can only be marked by scanning the code within the first 10-15 seconds of the class.
Ensures students are present in the classroom and prevents proxies.

2. Google Form Integration
Centralized Form Management:
Forms are categorized for ease of access:
Class Review: For rating classes.
Important Section: Includes critical forms (e.g., Hackathon or Entrepreneurship events).
Urgent Section: Forms that need immediate attention (e.g., forms with a 10-15 minute deadline).
Club President Forms: For approved students who are club presidents to post forms.

Features for Form Posting:
Admins can:
Set form expiration times.
Students can:
Post forms only if they include a valid link.

3. Problem Reporting System
General Problems:
Subdivided into two categories:
Campus Issues (e.g., parking problems, facilities).
Hostel Issues (e.g., food quality, WiFi issues).
Voting System:
Students can vote for existing problems instead of posting duplicates.
Problems are sorted by vote count to prioritize critical issues.
Admin Actions:
Admins can delete duplicate or resolved problems.
Problems marked as solved display a "Problem Solved" status.
Personal Problems:
Private problem reporting for sensitive issues (e.g., ragging, harassment).
Privacy Features:
Problems are visible only to authorized personnel.
Student anonymity is maintained.


How to Use the System:
For Colleges (Admins):
Sign Up and Create a College Section:
Add the college name, address, logo, and unique code.
Add Students:
Approve student accounts and assign them to the college section.
Post Forms:
Use the Google Form Integration to post important forms.
Set expiration times and manage form sections.
For Students:
Sign Up and Join College:
Sign up and join a college by entering the unique college code.
Mark Attendance:
Scan the QR code at the start of class to mark attendance.
Access Google Forms:
Navigate to the relevant sections to access forms.
Report Problems:
Post issues under the general or personal problem categories.
Vote for existing problems instead of posting duplicates.


Programming Languages and Tools Used:
Frontend:
HTML5: For structuring the webpages.
CSS3: For responsive and visually appealing designs.
JavaScript: For dynamic interactions, QR code generation, and form handling.
Libraries and APIs:
Html5Qrcode Library: For QR code scanning and generation.
Browser localStorage: For data persistence (e.g., storing attendance, forms, and problems).


Advantages of the System:
Prevents Proxy Attendance:
QR code-based system ensures physical presence in class.
Efficient Form Handling:
Categorized forms reduce clutter and ensure students donâ€™t miss critical forms.
Enhanced Problem Management:
Voting and anonymity features streamline problem-solving and build trust.
User-Friendly Interface:
Responsive design for accessibility across devices.
Customizable Settings for Admins:
Flexibility in managing forms and problem resolution.


Future Enhancements:
Integration with cloud databases for large-scale deployment.
Mobile App Development for enhanced user experience.


Advanced analytics dashboard for attendance and problem statistics.
